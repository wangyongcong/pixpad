	Dmitry Vyukov's SPSC queue

	From http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/queues/unbounded-spsc-queue
	(and http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/single-producer-single-consumer-queue)

	Unbounded single-producer/single-consumer node-based queue.
	Internal non-reducible cache of nodes is used.
	Dequeue operation is always wait-free.
	Enqueue operation is wait-free in common case (when there is available node in the cache),
	otherwise enqueue operation calls ::operator new(), so probably not wait-free.
	No atomic RMW operations nor heavy memory fences are used, i.e. enqueue and dequeue operations issue just several plain loads,
	several plain stores and one conditional branching.
	Cache-conscious data layout is used, so producer and consumer can work simultaneously causing no cache-coherence traffic.

	Single-producer/single-consumer queue can be used for communication with thread which services hardware device (wait-free property is required),
	or when there are naturally only one producer and one consumer.
	Also N single-producer/single-consumer queues can be used to construct multi-producer/single-consumer queue,
	or N^2 queues can be used to construct fully-connected system of N threads (other partially-connected topologies are also possible).

	Hardware platform: x86-32/64
	Compiler: Intel C++ Compiler
